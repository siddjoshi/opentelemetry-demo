  <strong>Tip:</strong>
  At the right place and at the right time, Copilot's suggestions can make it fine! 
</div>

***Your job is to navigate to the correct folder of the repository, and ask Copilot to describe the architecture used in this repo, identify the various services and the languages they are implemented in!***

_hint: you'll want to navigate to one of the sub-folders_

The adventurer who gets the below right clears this level!
1. Overall repo architecture
2. The various services
3. The implementation languages

## Challenge - 2
### Explain the Recommendation Service
Hey adventurer! Are you a visual person? Someone who loves to dismantle & re-assemble things. This level is for you!
With the help of the Copilot Extension for Mermaid Charts, create an architecture diagram of the `Recommendation Service`. 

#### Example Mermaid Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] --> B[ Service1]
    B --> C[Service2]
    B --> D[Service3]
    C --> E[File Syste]

```

_hint: You may need to ensure the Copilot extension is indeed available in your quiver, err browser_
